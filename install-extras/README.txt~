build_arm_toolchain.sh :
This file is used in step 1 of the nxtOSEK installation in Linux (http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/installation_linux.htm). In the tutorial the shell file is configured to install binutils-2.20 instead of binutils-2.20.1. However the version 2.20 is not available. Therefore this shell on our repository is configured to use binutils-2.20.1
